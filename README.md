I am a lifelong learner and aspiring polymath from Bangladesh 🇧🇩, driven by a deep intellectual curiosity across disciplines. My journey spans computer science, mathematics, classical physics, and design—each pursued not merely for academic achievement but for meaningful application and synthesis.

As a philomath, I thrive on structured exploration, rigorous problem-solving, and the art of connecting ideas across domains. Whether I'm refining algorithms on LeetCode, building portable development environments, or crafting intuitive UI assets, I approach each challenge with intentionality, precision, and a commitment to ethical clarity.
